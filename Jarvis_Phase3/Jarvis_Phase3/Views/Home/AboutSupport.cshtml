                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>With the proliferation Wi-Fi connected devices in our homes it's becoming increasingly difficult to monitor and manage all your various smart locks, lights, thermostats, etc. With Jarvis we simplify the use of multiple smart devices by giving you a single, easy-to-use, cross-platform interface that enables you to quickly see what's going on and to remotely change the settings of all your smart devices with just a few clicks.</p>
                <h3>What can Jarvis do?</h3>
                <p>With Jarvis you can schedule events and access the settings of all your internet-connected appliances from the other side of the world. View and edit your various devices' scheduled events remotely by highlighting all affected accessories and choosing the new setting. Jarvis makes home automation available to virtually any homeowner.</p>
                <h3>How can Jarvis help you?</h3>
                <p>But Jarvis is more than just a single platform for monitoring and configuring all your smart devices. Having all your connected devices in a single interface also enables you to get all the diverse feedback they generate in a single dashboard. Get data on how the performance of your devices compares to similar households and how you could be saving energy and possibly making your home even more efficient. Jarvis fully integrates with your BC Hydro, Terasen Gas, and all municipal smart metering systems to get a complete picture of your house's diagnostics.</p>
                <h3>How much will Jarvis cost me?</h3>
                <p>Jarvis charges a flat monthly charge of $4.95 for an account that entitles subscribers to connect and monitor up to 20 devices. All collected data is warehoused on our servers for one month and entitles you up to 200 MB of storage space. Additional cloud storage and the storage of longer term data is available at an additional charge.</p>
                <h3>Is there a free trial available?</h3>
                <p>Yes, We also offer a free one-month fully-functional trial that allows you evaluate all the features that will be included in a full subscription.</p>
                <h3>Why should you choose Jarvis?</h3>
                <p>
                    While many smart device manufacturers (such as Google, Amazon, and Samsung) also offer users the management, monitoring, and some storage of short-term data storage, Jarvis is currently the only smart device connection platform that's OEM agnostic (we allow you to hook up devices from multiple providers). Only Jarvis offers cross-platform monitoring of the performance of your wifi-connected devices and an extensive inventorying of historical data. Only Jarvis' AI alogrithms give you efficiency profiles and demographic insights into your connected devices that empowers you to make the most use of these devices by giving you real-time and historical feedback.

                <h1>FAQ</h1>

                <h3>Q: How do I register devices from another provider?  </h3>
                <p>
                    Its easy, all you have to do is login, and from your dashboard click Register devices.
                    It will then take you to a form, where you enter the provider account log in information,
                    and all your devices will be added to your dashboard.

                <h3>Q: How can I customize the insights that appear in my Insights display? </h3>
                <p>
                    The various insights that appear in your Insights page are generated by our AI algorithms based on the available
                    information that Jarvis has in the system. You can get better insights by customizing your settings with more
                    data. For example, the optimal temperature settings for Nest Labs thermostats are based on your geographic location, the available statistics for your neighborhood, the rooms you choose to heat and monitor, the size of the household, etc. You can enter additional data to customize your Insights in the Insights Data page.
                </p>

                <h3>Q: Can I monitor and configure my settings from anywhere in the world? </h3>
                <p>
                    So long as you have an internet connection you should be able to connect to the Jarvis platform and
                    change your appliances' settings from anywhere. You can also set up notifications/alerts that can be
                    sent to any mobile device.

                    that record temperature, rain, wind, UV, electricity, gas, water, etc. are well supported so long
                    as you they're transmitting data to most major utilities.
